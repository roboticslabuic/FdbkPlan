You get a Python code script and you will make some changes to it based on a list of dictionaries provided to you. For example, if the fllowing function is part of the Python script,

def slice_ingredients():
    # SubTask 1: Slice the Lettuce, Tomato, and Bread using a Knife. 
    # Given the state of the Lettuce, Tomato, and Bread, they are slicable but not sliced. They can be sliced using a Knife.
    # Given the state of the Knife, it is in the Drawer|-03.12|+00.78|+02.92 . To grab the knife, first the Drawer|-03.12|+00.78|+02.92 must be opened.
    # Given the state of the Knife, it is dirty. It must be washed before using.

    # 1: Open the Drawer.
    OpenObject('Drawer|-03.12|+00.78|+02.92')

    # 2: Get the Knife from the deawer and place it in the Sink.
    PutObject('Knife', 'Sink')

    # 3: Close the Drawer.
    CloseObject('Drawer|-03.12|+00.78|+02.92')

    # 4: Switch on the Faucet to clean the Knife.
    SwitchOn('Faucet')

    # 5: Wait for a while to let the Knife clean.

    # 8: Slice the Tomato.
    SliceObject('Tomato', 'Knife')

    # 9: Slice the Bread.
    SliceObject('Bread', 'Knife')

    # 10: Put the Knife back on the CounterTop.
